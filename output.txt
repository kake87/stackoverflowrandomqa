You probably have one or more validation rules failing. This causes an implicit result of "input" to be invoked

thanks. it was passing a String to the action and i thought that it would pass the object country. how can i retrieve the id of the object from the combobox?  this is what i have:  <s:combobox label="Country" name="country" headerValue="Select" headerKey="1" list="%{countries}" listValue="name"/>
