java profiler
QUESTION
Occasionally I have to do some profiling work on Java code, and I would like to know why I should have my boss investigate in a commercial profiler as opposed to just use the one in Netbeans or JConsole?
What would the killer features be that would warrant the investment?

I have experience using both NetBeans profiler and JProbe. For performance profiling I have found Netbeans quite useful but where JProbe is superior is for memory profiling. 
JProbe has superior tools for comparing heap snapshots and finding the root cause of a memory leak. For example, in JProbe you can view heap shapshots visually as a graph, select nodes to investigate and then delete references to see if the instance could then be garbage collected.
